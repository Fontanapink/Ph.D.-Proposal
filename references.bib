  abstract = {Synthetic biology is frequently defined as the application of engineering design principles to biology. Such principles are intended to streamline the practice of biological engineering, to shorten the time required to design, build, and test synthetic gene networks. This streamlining of iterative design cycles can facilitate the future construction of biological systems for a range of applications in the production of fuels, foods, materials, and medicines. The promise of these potential applications as well as the emphasis on design has prompted critical reflection on synthetic biology from design theorists and practicing designers from many fields, who can bring valuable perspectives to the discipline. While interdisciplinary connections between biologists and engineers have built synthetic biology via the science and the technology of biology, interdisciplinary collaboration with artists, designers, and social theorists can provide insight on the connections between technology and society. Such collaborations can open up new avenues and new principles for research and design, as well as shed new light on the challenging context-dependence—both biological and social—that face living technologies at many scales. This review is inspired by the session titled “Design and Synthetic Biology: Connecting People and Technology” at Synthetic Biology 6.0 and covers a range of literature on design practice in synthetic biology and beyond. Critical engagement with how design is used to shape the discipline opens up new possibilities for how we might design the future of synthetic biology.},

  abstract = {An important goal of synthetic biology is to build biosensors and circuits with well-defined input–output relationships that operate at speeds found in natural biological systems. However, for molecular computation, most commonly used genetic circuit elements typically involve several steps from input detection to output signal production: transcription, translation, and post-translational modifications. These multiple steps together require up to several hours to respond to a single stimulus, and this limits the overall speed and complexity of genetic circuits. To address this gap, molecular frameworks that rely exclusively on post-translational steps to realize reaction networks that can process inputs at a time scale of seconds to minutes have been proposed. Here, we build mathematical models of fast biosensors capable of producing Boolean logic functionality. We employ protease-based chemical and light-induced switches, investigate their operation, and provide selection guidelines for their use as on–off switches. As a proof of concept, we implement a rapamycin-induced switch in vitro and demonstrate that its response qualitatively agrees with the predictions from our models. We then use these switches as elementary blocks, developing models for biosensors that can perform OR and XOR Boolean logic computation while using reaction conditions as tuning parameters. We use sensitivity analysis to determine the time-dependent sensitivity of the output to proteolytic and protein–protein binding reaction parameters. These fast protease-based biosensors can be used to implement complex molecular circuits with a capability of processing multiple inputs controllably and algorithmically. Our framework for evaluating and optimizing circuit performance can be applied to other molecular logic circuits.},

We outline the basic features of synthetic biology as a new engineering discipline, covering examples from the latest literature and reflecting on the features that make it unique among all other existing engineering fields. We discuss methods for designing and constructing engineered cells with novel functions in a framework of an abstract hierarchy of biological devices, modules, cells, and multicellular systems. The classical engineering strategies of standardization, decoupling, and abstraction will have to be extended to take into account the inherent characteristics of biological devices and modules. To achieve predictability and reliability, strategies for engineering biology must include the notion of cellular context in the functional definition of devices and modules, use rational redesign and directed evolution for system optimization, and focus on accomplishing tasks using cell populations rather than individual cells. The discussion brings to light issues at the heart of designing complex living systems and provides a trajectory for future development.},

We introduce the method by examining a positive feedback gene regulatory network, and show how the transient dynamics of this network are more accurately modeled when the prefactor is included. Next, we examine the repressilator, a genetic oscillator, and show that the period, amplitude, and bifurcation diagram defining the onset of the oscillations are better estimated by the prefactor method. Finally, we examine the consequences of the method to the dynamics of reduced models of the phage lambda switch, and show that the switching times between the two states is slowed by the presence of the prefactor that arises from protein multimerization and DNA binding.},

  abstract = {Much of the information available about factors that affect mRNA decay in Escherichia coli, and by inference in other bacteria, has been gleaned from study of less than 25 of the ≈4,300 predicted E. coli messages. To investigate these factors more broadly, we examined the half-lives and steady-state abundance of known and predicted E. coli mRNAs at single-gene resolution by using two-color fluorescent DNA microarrays. An rRNA-based strategy for normalization of microarray data was developed to permit quantitation of mRNA decay after transcriptional arrest by rifampicin. We found that globally, mRNA half-lives were similar in nutrient-rich media and defined media in which the generation time was approximately tripled. A wide range of stabilities was observed for individual mRNAs of E. coli, although ≈80\% of all mRNAs had half-lives between 3 and 8 min. Genes having biologically related metabolic functions were commonly observed to have similar stabilities. Whereas the half-lives of a limited number of mRNAs correlated positively with their abundance, we found that overall, increased mRNA stability is not predictive of increased abundance. Neither the density of putative sites of cleavage by RNase E, which is believed to initiate mRNA decay in E. coli, nor the free energy of folding of 5′ or 3′ untranslated region sequences was predictive of mRNA half-life. Our results identify previously unsuspected features of mRNA decay at a global level and also indicate that generalizations about decay derived from the study of individual gene transcripts may have limited applicability.},

  abstract = {Quantitative analysis of epigenetic memory
To explore quantitative and dynamic properties of transcriptional regulation by epigenetic modifications, Bintu et al. monitored a transcriptional reporter gene carried on a human artificial chromosome in Chinese hamster ovary cells (see the Perspective by Keung and Khalil). They measured effects of DNA methylation and histone modifications by methylation or deacetylation in single cells using time-lapse microscopy. Silencing was an all-or-none, stochastic event, so graded adjustments to transcription occurred from changes in the proportion of cells that responded. Furthermore, the duration of recruitment of the chromatin regulators determined the fraction of cells that were silenced. Thus, distinct modifiers can produce different characteristics of epigenetic memory.
Science, this issue p. 720; see also p. 661
Chromatin regulators play a major role in establishing and maintaining gene expression states. Yet how they control gene expression in single cells, quantitatively and over time, remains unclear. We used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the dynamic effects of four silencers associated with diverse modifications: DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, and histone methylation. For all regulators, silencing and reactivation occurred in all-or-none events, enabling the regulators to modulate the fraction of cells silenced rather than the amount of gene expression. These dynamics could be described by a three-state model involving stochastic transitions between active, reversibly silent, and irreversibly silent states. Through their individual transition rates, these regulators operate over different time scales and generate distinct types of epigenetic memory. Our results provide a framework for understanding and engineering mammalian chromatin regulation and epigenetic memory.
Quantitative, single-cell measurements reveal characteristics of epigenetic control of transcription. [Also see Perspective by Keung and Khalil]

  abstract = {Synthetic biology is reaching the situation where tuning devices by hand is no longer possible due to the complexity of the biological circuits being designed. Thus, mathematical models need to be used in order, not only to predict the behavior of the designed synthetic devices; but to help on the selection of the biological parts, i.e., guidelines for the experimental implementation. However, since uncertainties are inherent to biology, the desired dynamics for the circuit usually requires a trade-off among several goals. Hence, a multi-objective optimization design (MOOD) naturally arises to get a suitable parametrization (or range) of the required kinetic parameters to build a biological device with some desired properties. Biologists have classically addressed this problem by evaluating a set of random Monte Carlo simulations with parameters between an operation range. In this paper, we propose solving the MOOD by means of dynamic programming using both a global multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) and a local gradient-based nonlinear programming (NLP) solver. The performance of both alternatives is then checked in the design of a well-known biological circuit: a genetic incoherent feed-forward loop showing adaptive behavior.},

  abstract = {Building on recombinant DNA technology, leaps in synthesis, assembly, and analysis of DNA have revolutionized genetics and molecular biology over the past two decades (Kosuri and Church, 2014). These technological advances have accelerated the emergence of synthetic biology as a new discipline (Cameron et al., 2014). Synthetic biology is characterized by efforts targeted at the modification of existing and the design of novel biological systems based on principles adopted from information technology and engineering (Andrianantoandro et al., 2006; Khalil and Collins, 2010). As in more traditional engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical and civil engineering, synthetic biologists utilize abstraction, decoupling and standardization to make the design of biological systems more efficient and scalable. To facilitate the management of complexity, synthetic biology relies on an abstraction hierarchy composed of multiple levels (Endy, 2005): DNA as genetic material, “parts” as elements of DNA encoding basic biological functions (e.g. promoter, ribosome-binding site, terminator sequence), “devices” as any combination of parts implementing a human-defined function, and “systems” as any combination of devices fulfilling a predefined purpose. Parts are designated to perform predictable and modular functions in the context of higher-level devices or systems, which are successively refined through a cycle of designing, building, and testing.},

  abstract = {This book serves as an introduction to the myriad computational approaches to gene regulatory modeling and analysis, and is written specifically with experimental biologists in mind. Mathematical jargon is avoided and explanations are given in intuitive terms. In cases where equations are unavoidable, they are derived from first principles or, at the very least, an intuitive description is provided. Extensive examples and a large number of model descriptions are provided for use in both classroom exercises as well as self-guided exploration and learning. As such, the book is ideal for self- learning and also as the basis of a semester-long course for undergraduate and graduate students in molecular biology, bioengineering, genome sciences, or systems biology.

Usually, for static hazards, but not dynamic hazards, these situations can be predicted using a logic simulator. In this paper we present procedures which can be added to path sensitization test generation algorithms so that the resulting procedure will not produce tests which will be invalidated due to hazards. Incidental to this work is a new simulation technique for handling both static and dynamic hazards. The principal concepts behind this work deal with detecting when hazards are created in a circuit; propagating hazard status information related to a signal line through a circuit; detecting those conditions at flip-flop inputs which necessitate hazard free conditions; and finally, selecting test inputs so that all hazard free conditions are satisfied.},

Such pulses not only may cause errors in the circuit operation, but also consume energy, and add to the computation time. It is therefore very important to detect hazards in circuit designs. Two-valued Boolean algebra, which is commonly used for the analysis and synthesis of digital circuits, cannot detect hazard conditions directly. To overcome this limitation several multi-valued algebras have been proposed for hazard detection. This paper surveys these algebras, and studies their mathematical properties. Also, some recent results unifying most of the multi-valued algebras presented in the literature are described. Our attention in this paper is restricted to the study of static and dynamic hazards in gate circuits.},

We use the resulting framework to describe one engineered biological device, a genetically encoded cell-cell communication receiver named BBa\_F2620. The description of the receiver is summarized via a 'datasheet' similar to those widely used in engineering. The process of refinement and characterization leading to the BBa\_F2620 datasheet may serve as a starting template for producing many standardized genetically encoded objects.},

O. sulphurea is a species that is largely distributed in the Monte region of Argentina, where it has been used as an edible resource, especially in periods of food shortage. This is the first report evaluating the chemical composition of O. sulphurea cladodes. Our results show that cladodes are composed primarily of water, as with most other prickly pears that have been studied, which is consistent with their expected role as water reservoir in desert communities. Ash and protein content in O. sulphurea are consistent with values found for other species of the genus, whereas carbohydrates are well below levels of other Opuntia spp. Finally, the percentage of lipids in O. sulphurea cladodes is larger than in other studied species and fatty acid composition is quite different from observations made in similar studies. These earlier studies showed that linoleic acid is the major constituent of fatty acid fractions, followed by palmitic and oleic acids. Our analyses showed that these fatty acids are also principal constituents of O. sulphurea cladodes, although linolenic acid proved to be the most abundant. Curiously, the previous works found relatively low quantities of this fatty acid. Other minor fatty acids were also detected in cladodes of O. sulphurea, although the percentages are larger than in other studies of prickly pears. We discuss our results in the context of the potential nutraceutical and economic utility of O. sulphurea cladodes as a new source of essential fatty acids, especially in semi-arid areas as the Monte region where this species represents an abundant edible resource which is available even in periods of scarcity.},

  abstract = {Qualitative frameworks, especially those based on the logical discrete formalism, are increasingly used to model regulatory and signalling networks. A major advantage of these frameworks is that they do not require precise quantitative data, and that they are well-suited for studies of large networks. While numerous groups have developed specific computational tools that provide original methods to analyse qualitative models, a standard format to exchange qualitative models has been missing.},

We have measured the strengths of a library of terminators, including 227 that are annotated in Escherichia coli—90 of which we also tested in the reverse orientation—and 265 synthetic terminators. Within this library we found 39 strong terminators, yielding {$>$}50-fold reduction in downstream expression, that have sufficient sequence diversity to reduce homologous recombination when used together in a design. We used these data to determine how the terminator sequence contributes to its strength. The dominant parameters were incorporated into a biophysical model that considers the role of the hairpin in the displacement of the U-tract from the DNA. The availability of many terminators of varying strength, as well as an understanding of the sequence dependence of their properties, will extend their usability in the forward design of synthetic cistrons.},

Here, we report a genome-wide RNA degradation study in Escherichia coli using RNA-seq, and present evidence that the stereotypical exponential RNA decay curve obtained using initiation inhibitor, rifampicin, consists of two phases: residual RNA synthesis, a delay in the interruption of steady state that is dependent on distance relative to the mRNA's 5′ end, and the exponential decay. This gives a more accurate RNA lifetime and RNA polymerase elongation rate simultaneously genome-wide. Transcripts typically have a single RNA decay constant along all positions, which is distinct between different operons, indicating that RNA stability is unlikely determined by local sequences. These measurements allowed us to establish a model for RNA processing involving co-transcriptional degradation, providing quantitative description of the macromolecular coordination in gene expression in bacteria on a system-wide level.},

Specifically, we would like to be able to build systems using standard parts that, when combined, have reliable and predictable behavior.  Here, we define standard characteristics for describing the absolute physical performance of genetic parts that control gene expression.  The first characteristic, PoPS, defines the level of transcription as the number of RNA polymerase molecules that pass a point on DNA each second, on a per DNA copy basis (PoPS = Polymerase Per Second; PoPSdc = PoPS per DNA copy).  The second characteristic, RiPS, defines the level of translation as the number of ribosome molecules that pass a point on mRNA each second, on a per mRNA copy basis (RiPS = Ribosomes Per Second; RiPSmc = RiPS per mRNA copy).  In theory, it should be possible to routinely combine devices that send and receive PoPS and RiPS signals to produce gene expression-based systems whose quantiative behavior is easy to predict.  To begin to evaluate the utility of the PoPS and RIPS framework we are characterizing the performance of a simple gene expression device in E. coli growing at steady state under standard operating conditions; we are using a simple ordinary differential equation model to estimate the steady state PoPS and RiPS levels.},

In contrast to classical cell engineering approaches, synthetic biology enables cellular networks to be understood as a combination of modular elements in much the same way as unit operations combine to describe a chemical plant. Consequently, models for the behavior of these designed systems are inspired by frameworks developed for traditional chemical engineering design. There are direct analogies between cellular metabolism and reaction networks in a chemical process. As examples, thermodynamic and kinetic models of chemical reaction networks have been used to simulate fluxes within living systems and predict the performance of synthetic parts. Concepts from process control have been brought to bear on the design of transcriptional and translational regulatory networks. Such engineering frameworks have greatly aided the design and understanding of living systems and have enabled the design of cells exhibiting complex dynamic behavior and high productivity of desirable compounds. This review summarizes efforts to quantitatively model cellular behavior (both endogenous and synthetic), especially as related to the design of living systems.},

An application of the procedure is performed on a model of protocell, in order to detect the kinetic rates mainly affecting the capability of a catalytic reaction network enclosed in a semi-permeable membrane to retain material from its environment and to generate a variety of molecular species within its boundaries. It is shown that the former capability is scarcely sensitive to variations in the model parameters, whereas a kinetic rate responsible for profound modifications of the latter can be identified and it depends on the specific reaction network. A faster uptaking of limited resources from the environment may have represented a significant advantage from an evolutionary point of view and this result is a first indication in order to decipher which kind of structures are more suitable to achieve a viable evolution.},

  abstract = {A long-standing goal of synthetic biology is to rapidly engineer new regulatory circuits from simpler devices. As circuit complexity grows, it becomes increasingly important to guide design with quantitative models, but previous efforts have been hindered by lack of predictive accuracy. To address this, we developed Empirical Quantitative Incremental Prediction (EQuIP), a new method for accurate prediction of genetic regulatory network behavior from detailed characterizations of their components. In EQuIP, precisely calibrated time-series and dosage-response assays are used to construct hybrid phenotypic/ mechanistic models of regulatory processes. This hybrid method ensures that model parameters match observable phenomena, using phenotypic formulation where current hypotheses about biological mechanisms do not agree closely with experimental observations. We demonstrate EQuIP’s precision at predicting distributions of cell behaviors for six transcriptional cascades and three feed-forward circuits in mammalian cells. Our cascade predictions have only 1.6-fold mean error over a 261-fold mean range of fluorescence variation, owing primarily to calibrated measurements and piecewise-linear models. Predictions for three feed-forward circuits had a 2.0-fold mean error on a 333-fold mean range, further demonstrating that EQuIP can scale to more complex systems. Such accurate predictions will foster reliable forward engineering of complex biological circuits from libraries of standardized devices.},

However, standardization of the synthetic biology workflow has not kept abreast with dwindling technical and resource constraints, leading, for example, to the collection of multi-level and multi-omics large data sets that end up disconnected or remain under- or even unexploited.Purpose: In this contribution, we critically evaluate the various efforts, and the (limited) success thereof, in order to introduce standards for defining, designing, assembling, characterizing, and sharing synthetic biology parts. The causes for this success or the lack thereof, as well as possible solutions to overcome these, are discussed.Conclusion: Akin to other engineering disciplines, extensive standardization will undoubtedly speed-up and reduce the cost of bioprocess development. In this respect, further implementation of synthetic biology standards will be crucial for the field in order to redeem its promise, i.e. to enable predictable forward engineering.},

  abstract = {In order to understand the functioning of organisms on the molecular level, we need to know which genes are expressed, when and where in the organism, and to which extent. The regulation of gene expression          is achieved through genetic regulatory systems structured by networks of interactions between DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules. As most genetic regulatory networks of interest involve many components          connected through interlocking positive and negative feedback loops, an intuitive understanding of their dynamics is hard to obtain. As a consequence, formal methods and computer tools for the modeling          and simulation of genetic regulatory networks will be indispensable. This paper reviews formalisms that have been employed in mathematical biology and bioinformatics to describe genetic regulatory systems,          in particular directed graphs, Bayesian networks, Boolean networks and their generalizations, ordinary and partial differential equations, qualitative differential equations, stochastic equations, and rule-based          formalisms. In addition, the paper discusses how these formalisms have been used in the simulation of the behavior of actual regulatory systems.},

  abstract = {In this report, the development of an empirical model demonstrating the dynamic function of a synthetic genetic circuit is presented. The model is based on a bacterial transcription unit encoding a protein and the kinetics of transcription and translation. However, the kinetic model was mathematically manipulated to pool parameters of unknown value into a set of distinct meaningful variables. These variables are to be either fitted to data (once data is obtained) or selected from existing models to allow for agreeing results. The equations were developed as interdependent 1st order ODEs and coded accordingly. Variables were categorized, those affecting the dynamic response time were chosen as fitting variables and given generic values from the literature for now. Others that determined the steady state response were selected to match an existing model (Cello). The predicted response was studied for a sample circuit and discussions are presented based on RNAseq and Riboseq data for the steady state. This model is proposed so as to have suitable variables allowing for fitting, with the knowledge that during development no time series data was available.},

Construction of such devices should provide us with insight on the design of natural systems, indicating whether our understanding is complete or whether there are still gaps in our knowledge. Construction of simple biological systems may also lay the groundwork for the construction of more complex systems that have practical utility. To realize its full potential, biological systems design borrows from the allied fields of protein design and metabolic engineering.

The various types of hazards connected with gate-type sequential circuits are also discussed, and a general technique is described that will detect any type of hazard or race condition that could result in an incorrect terminal state.

Noise, far from just a nuisance, has begun to be appreciated for its essential role in key cellular activities. Noise functions in both microbial and eukaryotic cells, in multicellular development, and in evolution. It enables coordination of gene expression across large regulons, as well as probabilistic differentiation strategies that function across cell populations. At the longest timescales, noise may facilitate evolutionary transitions. Here we review examples and emerging principles that connect noise, the architecture of the gene circuits in which it is present, and the biological functions it enables.

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock3,4,5 to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such ‘rational network design’ may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

  abstract = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are quite large and complex. To better understand and analyse GRNs, mathematical models are being employed. Different types of models, such as logical, continuous and stochastic models, can be used to describe GRNs. In this paper, we present a new approach to identify continuous models, because they are more suitable for large number of genes and quantitative analysis. One of the most promising techniques for identifying continuous models of GRNs is based on Hill functions and the generalized profiling method (GPM). The advantage of this approach is low computational cost and insensitivity to initial conditions. In the GPM, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem has to be solved that is usually underdetermined. In this paper, we propose a new optimization approach in which we reformulate the optimization problem such that constraints are embedded implicitly in the cost function. Moreover, we propose to split the unknown parameter in two sets based on the structure of Hill functions. These two sets are estimated separately to resolve the issue of the underdetermined problem. As a case study, we apply the proposed technique on the SOS response in Escherichia coli and compare the results with the existing literature.},

Two major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004, we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example, we integrated other systems biology workbench enabled simulation/analysis software packages. CellDesigner also supports simulation and parameter search, supported by integration with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/simulating tool but also an integrated analysis suite.

Because we used the chromatin remodeller Mxi1, our gates showed minimal leak and digital responses. We built a combinatorial library of NOR gates that directly convert guide RNA (gRNA) inputs into gRNA outputs, enabling the gates to be ‘wired’ together. We constructed logic circuits with up to seven gRNAs, including repression cascades with up to seven layers. Modelling predicted the NOR gates have effectively zero transcriptional leak explaining the limited signal degradation in the circuits. Our approach enabled the largest, eukaryotic gene circuits to date and will form the basis for large, synthetic, cellular decision-making systems.},

Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch—a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network—in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.},

Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins—and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80\% of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 106 molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon bias measurements.},

The genetic interrogation and reprogramming of cells requires methods for robust and precise targeting of genes for expression or repression. The CRISPR-associated catalytically inactive dCas9 protein offers a general platform for RNA-guided DNA targeting. Here, we show that fusion of dCas9 to effector domains with distinct regulatory functions enables stable and efficient transcriptional repression or activation in human and yeast cells, with the site of delivery determined solely by a coexpressed short guide (sg)RNA. Coupling of dCas9 to a transcriptional repressor domain can robustly silence expression of multiple endogenous genes. RNA-seq analysis indicates that CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated transcriptional repression is highly specific. Our results establish that the CRISPR system can be used as a modular and flexible DNA-binding platform for the recruitment of proteins to a target DNA sequence, revealing the potential of CRISPRi as a general tool for the precise regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.},

Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

  abstract = {Genetic circuits implement computational operations within a cell. Debugging them is difficult because their function is defined by multiple states (e.g., combinations of inputs) that vary in time. Here, we develop RNA‐seq methods that enable the simultaneous measurement of: (i) the states of internal gates, (ii) part performance (promoters, insulators, terminators), and (iii) impact on host gene expression. This is applied to a three‐input one‐output circuit consisting of three sensors, five NOR/NOT gates, and 46 genetic parts. Transcription profiles are obtained for all eight combinations of inputs, from which biophysical models can extract part activities and the response functions of sensors and gates. Various unexpected failure modes are identified, including cryptic antisense promoters, terminator failure, and a sensor malfunction due to media‐induced changes in host gene expression. This can guide the selection of new parts to fix these problems, which we demonstrate by using a bidirectional terminator to disrupt observed antisense transcription. This work introduces RNA‐seq as a powerful method for circuit characterization and debugging that overcomes the limitations of fluorescent reporters and scales to large systems composed of many parts.

Biophysical models based on RNA‐seq are developed to observe the internal workings of genetic circuits, and measure part performance, gate state, and impact on host gene expression. The approach is applied to analyze and debug a large genetic logic circuit.

Methods are developed to convert raw RNA‐seq data into transcription profiles that capture steady‐state RNA polymerase (RNAP) flux.RNAP flux, the common signal carrier between sensors and gates, can be calculated over the length of the circuit.Equations are derived to characterize part performance from changes in the transcription profiles.RNA‐seq data from a large genetic logic circuit is processed and their analysis reveals failures in the form of cryptic promoters, antisense transcription, terminator breakdown and sensor malfunction for differing growth conditions.},

  abstract = {Gut bacteria can affect key aspects of host fitness, such as development, fecundity, and lifespan, while the host, in turn, shapes the gut microbiome. However, it is unclear to what extent individual species versus community interactions within the microbiome are linked to host fitness. Here, we combinatorially dissect the natural microbiome of Drosophila melanogaster and reveal that interactions between bacteria shape host fitness through life history tradeoffs. Empirically, we made germ-free flies colonized with each possible combination of the five core species of fly gut bacteria. We measured the resulting bacterial community abundances and fly fitness traits, including development, reproduction, and lifespan. The fly gut promoted bacterial diversity, which, in turn, accelerated development, reproduction, and aging: Flies that reproduced more died sooner. From these measurements, we calculated the impact of bacterial interactions on fly fitness by adapting the mathematics of genetic epistasis to the microbiome. Development and fecundity converged with higher diversity, suggesting minimal dependence on interactions. However, host lifespan and microbiome abundances were highly dependent on interactions between bacterial species. Higher-order interactions (involving three, four, and five species) occurred in 13–44\% of possible cases depending on the trait, with the same interactions affecting multiple traits, a reflection of the life history tradeoff. Overall, we found these interactions were frequently context-dependent and often had the same magnitude as individual species themselves, indicating that the interactions can be as important as the individual species in gut microbiomes.},

The bifunctional QS switches were based on the Esa QS system, because EsaR regulatory proteins can act as transcriptional activator and repressor. The QS switches’ effectiveness and feasibility were verified through fluorescence characterization. Finally, the QS switches were applied to the production of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) to solve two key metabolic engineering problems: necessary gene knockout and redirection of metabolic flux. The production of PHB and ALA was increased 6- and 12-fold in Escherichia coli, respectively.},

Classical sensitivity analysis, however, does not directly apply to discrete stochastic dynamical systems, which have recently gained popularity because of its relevance in the simulation of biological processes. In this work, sensitivity analysis for discrete stochastic processes is developed based on density function (distribution) sensitivity, using an analog of the classical sensitivity and the Fisher Information Matrix. There exist many circumstances, such as in systems with multistability, in which the stochastic effects become nontrivial and classical sensitivity analysis on the deterministic representation of a system cannot adequately capture the true system behavior. The proposed analysis is applied to a bistable chemical system—the Schlögl model, and to a synthetic genetic toggle-switch model. Comparisons between the stochastic and deterministic analyses show the significance of explicit consideration of the probabilistic nature in the sensitivity analysis for this class of processes.},

Sensitivity values measure the responsiveness of an output with respect to the model parameters. They help in analysing the network, understanding its robustness properties and identifying the important reactions for a specific output. Sensitivity values are commonly estimated using methods that perform finite-difference computations along with Monte Carlo simulations of the reaction dynamics. These methods are computationally efficient and easy to implement, but they produce a biased estimate which can be unreliable for certain applications. Moreover, the size of the bias is generally unknown and hence the accuracy of these methods cannot be easily determined. There also exist unbiased schemes for sensitivity estimation but these schemes can be computationally infeasible, even for very simple networks. Our goal in this paper is to present a new method for sensitivity estimation, which combines the computational efficiency of finite-difference methods with the accuracy of unbiased schemes. Our method is easy to implement and it relies on an exact representation of parameter sensitivity that we recently proved elsewhere. Through examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the existing methods, both biased and unbiased, in many situations.},

  abstract = {Background
Quantitative analysis of simple molecular networks is an important step forward understanding fundamental intracellular processes. As network motifs occurring recurrently in complex biological networks, gene auto-regulatory circuits have been extensively studied but gene expression dynamics remain to be fully understood, e.g., how promoter leakage affects expression noise is unclear.

Results
In this work, we analyze a gene model with auto regulation, where the promoter is assumed to have one active state with highly efficient transcription and one inactive state with very lowly efficient transcription (termed as promoter leakage). We first derive the analytical distribution of gene product, and then analyze effects of promoter leakage on expression dynamics including bursting kinetics. Interestingly, we find that promoter leakage always reduces expression noise and that increasing the leakage rate tends to simplify phenotypes. In addition, higher leakage results in fewer bursts.

Conclusions
Our results reveal the essential role of promoter leakage in controlling expression dynamics and further phenotype. Specifically, promoter leakage is a universal mechanism of reducing expression noise, controlling phenotypes in different environments and making the gene produce generate fewer bursts.

  abstract = {Here we describe the development of tightly regulated expression switches in yeast, by engineering distant homologues of Escherichia coli TetR, including the transcriptional regulator PhlF from Pseudomonas and others. Previous studies demonstrated that the PhlF protein bound its operator sequence (phlO) in the absence of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) but dissociated from phlO in the presence of DAPG. Thus, we developed a DAPG-Off system in which expression of a gene preceded by the phlO-embedded promoter was activated by a fusion of PhlF to a multimerized viral activator protein (VP16) domain in a DAPG-free environment but repressed when DAPG was added to growth medium. In addition, we constructed a DAPG-On system with the opposite behavior of the DAPG-Off system; i.e., DAPG triggers the expression of a reporter gene. Exposure of DAPG to yeast cells did not cause any serious deleterious effect on yeast physiology in terms of growth. Efforts to engineer additional Tet repressor homologues were partially successful and a known mammalian switch, the p-cumate switch based on CymR from Pseudomonas, was found to function in yeast. Orthogonality between the TetR (doxycycline), CamR (d-camphor), PhlF (DAPG), and CymR (p-cumate)-based Off switches was demonstrated by evaluating all 4 ligands against suitably engineered yeast strains. This study expands the toolbox of "On" and "Off" switches for yeast biotechnology.},

The objective of the present study is to investigate the applicability of three widely used techniques to three computer models having large uncertainties and varying degrees of complexity in order to highlight some of the problem areas that must be addressed in actual applications. The following approaches to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis are considered: (1) response surface methodology based on input determined from a fractional factorial design; (2) Latin hypercube sampling with and without regression analysis; and (3) differential analysis. These techniques are investigated with respect to (1) ease of implementation, (2) flexibility, (3) estimation of the cumulative distribution function of the output, and (4) adaptability to different methods of sensitivity analysis. With respect to these criteria, the technique using Latin hypercube sampling and regression analysis had the best overall performance. The models used in the investigation are well documented, thus making it possible for researchers to make comparisons of other techniques with the results in this study.},

  abstract = {Artificial microbial ecosystems have been increasingly used to understand principles of ecology. These systems offer unique capabilities to mimic a variety of ecological interactions that otherwise would be difficult to study experimentally in a reasonable period of time. However, the elucidation of the genetic bases for these interactions remains a daunting challenge. To address this issue, we have designed and analysed a synthetic symbiotic ecosystem in which the genetic nature of the microbial interactions is defined explicitly. A mathematical model of the gene regulatory network in each species and their interaction through quorum sensing mediated intercellular signalling was derived to investigate the effect of system components on cooperative behaviour. Dynamic simulation and bifurcation analysis showed that the designed system admits a stable coexistence steady state for sufficiently large initial cell concentrations of the two species. The steady-state fraction of each species could be altered by varying model parameters associated with gene transcription and signalling molecule synthesis rates. The design also admitted a stable steady state corresponding to extinction of the two species for low initial cell concentrations and stable periodic solutions over certain domains of parameter space. The mathematical analysis was shown to provide insights into natural microbial ecosystems and to allow identification of molecular targets for engineering system behaviour.

This is the first method to compute Fisher information for stochastic chemical kinetics models without the need for Monte Carlo simulations. This methodology is then used to study sensitivity, robustness, and parameter identifiability in stochastic chemical kinetics models. We show that significant differences exist between stochastic and deterministic models as well as between stochastic models with time-series and time-point measurements. We demonstrate that these discrepancies arise from the variability in molecule numbers, correlations between species, and temporal correlations and show how this approach can be used in the analysis and design of experiments probing stochastic processes at the cellular level. The algorithm has been implemented as a Matlab package and is available from the authors upon request.},

  abstract = {The inability to predict heterologous gene expression levels precisely hinders our ability to engineer biological systems. Using well-characterized regulatory elements offers a potential solution only if such elements behave predictably when combined. We synthesized 12,563 combinations of common promoters and ribosome binding sites and simultaneously measured DNA, RNA, and protein levels from the entire library. Using a simple model, we found that RNA and protein expression were within twofold of expected levels 80\% and 64\% of the time, respectively. The large dataset allowed quantitation of global effects, such as translation rate on mRNA stability and mRNA secondary structure on translation rate. However, the worst 5\% of constructs deviated from prediction by 13-fold on average, which could hinder large-scale genetic engineering projects. The ease and scale this of approach indicates that rather than relying on prediction or standardization, we can screen synthetic libraries for desired behavior.},

Many of these genetic devices are engineered using multi-copy plasmids, but as the field progresses from proof-of-principle demonstrations to practical applications, it is important to develop single-copy synthetic modules that minimize consumption of cellular resources and can be stably maintained as genomic integrants. Here we use empirical design, mathematical modeling and iterative construction and testing to build single-copy, bistable toggle switches with improved performance and reduced metabolic load that can be stably integrated into the host genome. Deterministic and stochastic models led us to focus on basal transcription to optimize circuit performance and helped to explain the resulting circuit robustness across a large range of component expression levels. The design parameters developed here provide important guidance for future efforts to convert functional multi-copy gene circuits into optimized single-copy circuits for practical, real-world use.},

However, until recently, most synthetic biology systems have focused on bacteria. While there is a wealth of resources and literature about the biology of yeast, it can be daunting to navigate and extract the tools needed for engineering applications. Here we present a versatile engineering platform for yeast, which contains both a rapid, modular assembly method and a basic set of characterized parts. This platform provides a framework in which to create new designs, as well as data on promoters, terminators, degradation tags, and copy number to inform those designs. Additionally, we describe genome-editing tools for making modifications directly to the yeast chromosomes, which we find preferable to plasmids due to reduced variability in expression. With this toolkit, we strive to simplify the process of engineering yeast by standardizing the physical manipulations and suggesting best practices that together will enable more straightforward translation of materials and data from one group to another. Additionally, by relieving researchers of the burden of technical details, they can focus on higher-level aspects of experimental design.},

The method involves randomly varying all parameters, running a single simulation with each set of parameters, running simulations with hundreds of model variants, then statistically relating the parameters to the simulation results using regression methods. We tested this method on a stochastic model, containing 18 parameters, of the cardiac Ca2+ spark. Results show that~multivariable linear regression can successfully relate parameters to continuous model outputs such as Ca2+ spark amplitude and duration, and multivariable logistic regression can provide insight into how parameters affect Ca2+ spark triggering (a~probabilistic process that is all-or-none in a single simulation). Benchmark studies demonstrate that this method is less computationally intensive than standard methods by a factor of 16. Importantly, predictions were tested experimentally by measuring Ca2+ sparks in mice with knockout of the sarcoplasmic reticulum protein triadin. These mice exhibit multiple changes in Ca2+ release unit structures, and the regression model both accurately predicts changes in Ca2+ spark amplitude (30\% decrease in model, 29\% decrease in experiments) and provides an intuitive and quantitative understanding of how much each alteration contributes to the result. This approach is therefore an effective, efficient, and predictive method for analyzing stochastic mathematical models to gain biological insight.},

  abstract = {Background
The behaviour of biological systems can be deduced from their mathematical models. However, multiple sources of data in diverse forms are required in the construction of a model in order to define its components and their biochemical reactions, and corresponding parameters. Automating the assembly and use of systems biology models is dependent upon data integration processes involving the interoperation of data and analytical resources.

Results
Taverna workflows have been developed for the automated assembly of quantitative parameterised metabolic networks in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). A SBML model is built in a systematic fashion by the workflows which starts with the construction of a qualitative network using data from a MIRIAM-compliant genome-scale model of yeast metabolism. This is followed by parameterisation of the SBML model with experimental data from two repositories, the SABIO-RK enzyme kinetics database and a database of quantitative experimental results. The models are then calibrated and simulated in workflows that call out to COPASIWS, the web service interface to the COPASI software application for analysing biochemical networks. These systems biology workflows were evaluated for their ability to construct a parameterised model of yeast glycolysis.

Conclusions
Distributed information about metabolic reactions that have been described to MIRIAM standards enables the automated assembly of quantitative systems biology models of metabolic networks based on user-defined criteria. Such data integration processes can be implemented as Taverna workflows to provide a rapid overview of the components and their relationships within a biochemical system.},

  abstract = {We describe a new method for directly synthesizing a hazard-free multilevel logic implementation from a given logic specification. The method is based on free/ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD's), and is naturally applicable to multiple-output logic functions. Given an incompletely-specified (multiple-output) Boolean function, the method produces a multilevel logic network that is hazard-free for a specified set of multiple-input changes. We assume an arbitrary (unbounded) gate and wire delay model under a pure delay (PD) assumption, we permit multiple-input changes, and we consider both static and dynamic hazards under the fundamental-mode assumption. Our framework is thus general and powerful. While it is not always possible to generate hazard-free implementations using our technique, we show that in some cases hazard-free multilevel implementations can be generated when hazard-free two-level representations cannot be found. This problem is generally regarded as a difficult problem and it has important applications in the field of asynchronous design. The method has been automated and applied to a number of examples.{$<>$}},

The goals of this standard are to allow scientists to exchange designs of biological parts and systems, to facilitate the storage of genetic designs in repositories, and to facilitate the description of genetic designs in publications. In order to achieve these goals, the development of an infrastructure to store, retrieve, and exchange SBOL data is necessary. To address this problem, we have developed the SBOL Stack, a Resource Description Framework (RDF) database specifically designed for the storage, integration, and publication of SBOL data. This database allows users to define a library of synthetic parts and designs as a service, to share SBOL data with collaborators, and to store designs of biological systems locally. The database also allows external data sources to be integrated by mapping them to the SBOL data model. The SBOL Stack includes two Web interfaces: the SBOL Stack API and SynBioHub. While the former is designed for developers, the latter allows users to upload new SBOL biological designs, download SBOL documents, search by keyword, and visualize SBOL data. Since the SBOL Stack is based on semantic Web technology, the inherent distributed querying functionality of RDF databases can be used to allow different SBOL stack databases to be queried simultaneously, and therefore, data can be shared between different institutes, centers, or other users.},

  abstract = {De novo computational design of synthetic gene circuits that achieve well-defined target functions is a hard task. Existing, brute-force approaches run optimization algorithms on the structure and on the kinetic parameter values of the network. However, more direct rational methods for automatic circuit design are lacking. Focusing on digital synthetic gene circuits, we developed a methodology and a corresponding tool for in silico automatic design. For a given truth table that specifies a circuit's input–output relations, our algorithm generates and ranks several possible circuit schemes without the need for any optimization. Logic behavior is reproduced by the action of regulatory factors and chemicals on the promoters and on the ribosome binding sites of biological Boolean gates. Simulations of circuits with up to four inputs show a faithful and unequivocal truth table representation, even under parametric perturbations and stochastic noise. A comparison with already implemented circuits, in addition, reveals the potential for simpler designs with the same function. Therefore, we expect the method to help both in devising new circuits and in simplifying existing solutions.},

The original framework for modeling bacterial components and designing prokaryotic circuits evolved over the last years and brought, fi□rst, to the development of an algorithm for the automatic design of Boolean gene circuits. This is a remarkable achievement since gene digital circuits have a broad range of applications that goes from biosensors for health and environment care to computational devices. More recently, Parts \& Pools was enabled to give a proper formal description of eukaryotic biological circuit components. This was possible by employing a rule-based modeling approach, a technique that permits a faithful calculation of all the species and reactions involved in complex systems such as eukaryotic cells and compartments. In this way, Parts \& Pools is currently suitable for the visual and modular design of synthetic gene circuits in yeast and mammalian cells too.},

Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses.},

  abstract = {Modelling and computational simulation are crucial for the large-scale engineering of biological circuits since they allow the system under design to be simulated prior to implementation in vivo. To support automated, model-driven design it is desirable that in silico models are modular, composable and use standard formats. The synthetic biology design process typically involves the composition of genetic circuits from individual parts. At the most basic level, these parts are representations of genetic features such as promoters, ribosome binding sites (RBSs), and coding sequences (CDSs). However, it is also desirable to model the biological molecules and behaviour that arise when these parts are combined in vivo. Modular models of parts can be composed and their associated systems simulated, facilitating the process of model-centred design. The availability of databases of modular models is essential to support software tools used in the model-driven design process. In this article, we present an approach to support the development of composable, modular models for synthetic biology, termed Standard Virtual Parts. We then describe a programmatically accessible and publicly available database of these models to allow their use by computational design tools.},

Computational modeling often requires expert knowledge and data to build models. Clearly, manual creation of models is not scalable for large designs. Despite several automated model construction approaches, computational methodologies to bridge knowledge in design repositories and the process of creating computational models have still not been established. This paper describes a workflow for automatic generation of computational models of genetic circuits from data stored in design repositories using existing standards. This workflow leverages the software tool SBOLDesigner to build structural models that are then enriched by the Virtual Parts Repository API using Systems Biology Open Language (SBOL) data fetched from the SynBioHub design repository. The iBioSim software tool is then utilized to convert this SBOL description into a computational model encoded using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). Finally, this SBML model can be simulated using a variety of methods. This workflow provides synthetic biologists with easy to use tools to create predictable biological systems, hiding away the complexity of building computational models. This approach can further be incorporated into other computational workflows for design automation.},

This approach is currently hampered by a lack of well-defined and characterized parts and devices. However, there is a wealth of existing biological information, which can be used to identify and characterize biological parts, and their design constraints in the literature and numerous biological databases. However, this information is spread among these databases in many different formats. New computational approaches are required to make this information available in an integrated format that is more amenable to data mining. A tried and tested approach to this problem is to map disparate data sources into a single data set, with common syntax and semantics, to produce a data warehouse or knowledge base. Ontologies have been used extensively in the life sciences, providing this common syntax and semantics as a model for a given biological domain, in a fashion that is amenable to computational analysis and reasoning. Here, we present an ontology for applications in synthetic biology design, SyBiOnt, which facilitates the modeling of information about biological parts and their relationships. SyBiOnt was used to create the SyBiOntKB knowledge base, incorporating and building upon existing life sciences ontologies and standards. The reasoning capabilities of ontologies were then applied to automate the mining of biological parts from this knowledge base. We propose that this approach will be useful to speed up synthetic biology design and ultimately help facilitate the automation of the biological engineering life cycle.},

  abstract = {Genetic programs function to integrate environmental sensors, implement signal processing algorithms and control expression dynamics1. These programs consist of integrated genetic circuits that individually implement operations ranging from digital logic to dynamic circuits2,3,4,5,6, and they have been used in various cellular engineering applications, including the implementation of process control in metabolic networks and the coordination of spatial differentiation in artificial tissues. A key limitation is that the circuits are based on biochemical interactions occurring in the confined volume of the cell, so the size of programs has been limited to a few circuits1,7. Here we apply part mining and directed evolution to build a set of transcriptional AND gates in Escherichia coli. Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as the input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. Multiple activator–chaperone pairs are identified from type III secretion pathways in different strains of bacteria. Directed evolution is applied to increase the dynamic range and orthogonality of the circuits. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate that consists of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the complete program. Errors in the output due to delays (faults), a common problem for layered circuits, are not observed. This work demonstrates the successful layering of orthogonal logic gates, a design strategy that could enable the construction of large, integrated circuits in single cells.},

We engineered libraries of constitutive and repressor-regulated promoters along with translation initiation elements following these definitions. We measured activity distributions for each library and selected elements that collectively resulted in expression across a 1,000-fold observed dynamic range. We studied all combinations of curated elements, demonstrating that arbitrary genes are reliably expressed to within twofold relative target expression windows with ∼93\% reliability. We expect the genetic element definitions validated here can be collectively expanded to create collections of public-domain standard biological parts that support reliable forward engineering of gene expression at genome scales.},

Methods are lacking for researchers to affordably coordinate the quantification and analysis of part performance across varied environments, as needed to identify, evaluate and improve problematic part types. We developed an easy-to-use analysis of variance (ANOVA) framework for quantifying the performance of genetic elements. For proof of concept, we assembled and analyzed combinations of prokaryotic transcription and translation initiation elements in Escherichia coli. We determined how estimation of part activity relates to the number of unique element combinations tested, and we show how to estimate expected ensemble-wide part activity from just one or two measurements. We propose a new statistic, biomolecular part 'quality', for tracking quantitative variation in part performance across changing contexts.},

Here, we use rationally designed variants of the RNA-IN–RNA-OUT antisense RNA–mediated translation system from the insertion sequence IS10 to quantify {$>$}500 RNA-RNA interactions in Escherichia coli and integrate the data set with sequence-activity modeling to identify the thermodynamic stability of the duplex and the seed region as the key determinants of specificity. Applying this model, we predict the performance of an additional ∼2,600 antisense-regulator pairs, forecast the possibility of large families of orthogonal mutants, and forward engineer and experimentally validate two RNA pairs orthogonal to an existing group of five from the training data set. We discuss the potential use of these regulators in next-generation synthetic biology applications.},

For this purpose a perfusion apparatus has been constructed from a microsyringe filter holder. The conditions inside the apparatus are physiological and permit exponential growth up to 1 x 108 cells. Exchange of extracellular carrier leucine-12C with the intracellular leucine-14C pool is so rapid that at least 87\% of the amino acid arising from protein breakdown appears in the perfusate and is not recycled into protein even in growing cultures.
Only a limited portion of the cellular protein is subject to rapid degradation. It decays with a half-life of approximately 1 hour and constitutes 2 to 7\% of the total cellular protein of cells growing in glucose minimal medium under various nutritional conditions (including growth and starvation). The proportion of the total protein synthesis which is directed to the synthesis of this rapidly degrading protein component increases with decreasing growth rate. At very slow growth rates 10 to 40\% of the radioactivity that is incorporated into protein is incorporated into the rapidly degrading protein. Treatment which removes nonproteinaceous material and Pronase digestion of cells before and after the decay of the rapid component substantiates the conclusion that the rapidly decaying component is derived from bacterial protein.
There is another radioactive component in the perfusate which is released at the very slow rate of 0.2 to 0.6\% per hour for as long as the experiments are carried out (48 hours). This does not represent degradation of intracellular protein to amino acids since this process is independent of leucine exchange, and 30 to 50\% of the radioactivity in the perfusate is acid-insoluble.},

As synthetic biology techniques become more powerful, researchers are anticipating a future in which the design of biological circuits will be similar to the design of integrated circuits in electronics. Nielsen et al. describe what is essentially a programming language to design computational circuits in living cells. The circuits generated on plasmids expressed in Escherichia coli required careful insulation from their genetic context, but primarily functioned as specified. The circuits could, for example, regulate cellular functions in response to multiple environmental signals. Such a strategy can facilitate the development of more complex circuits by genetic engineering.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONCells respond to their environment, make decisions, build structures, and coordinate tasks. Underlying these processes are computational operations performed by networks of regulatory proteins that integrate signals and control the timing of gene expression. Harnessing this capability is critical for biotechnology projects that require decision-making, control, sensing, or spatial organization. It has been shown that cells can be programmed using synthetic genetic circuits composed of regulators organized to generate a desired operation. However, the construction of even simple circuits is time-intensive and unreliable.
RATIONALEElectronic design automation (EDA) was developed to aid engineers in the design of semiconductor-based electronics. In an effort to accelerate genetic circuit design, we applied principles from EDA to enable increased circuit complexity and to simplify the incorporation of synthetic gene regulation into genetic engineering projects. We used the hardware description language Verilog to enable a user to describe a circuit function. The user also specifies the sensors, actuators, and “user constraints file” (UCF), which defines the organism, gate technology, and valid operating conditions. Cello (www.cellocad.org) uses this information to automatically design a DNA sequence encoding the desired circuit. This is done via a set of algorithms that parse the Verilog text, create the circuit diagram, assign gates, balance constraints to build the DNA, and simulate performance.
RESULTSCello designs circuits by drawing upon a library of Boolean logic gates. Here, the gate technology consists of NOT/NOR logic based on repressors. Gate connection is simplified by defining the input and output signals as RNA polymerase (RNAP) fluxes. We found that the gates need to be insulated from their genetic context to function reliably in the context of different circuits. Each gate is isolated using strong terminators to block RNAP leakage, and input interchangeability is improved using ribozymes and promoter spacers. These parts are varied for each gate to avoid breakage due to recombination. Measuring the load of each gate and incorporating this into the optimization algorithms further reduces evolutionary pressure.Cello was applied to the design of 60 circuits for Escherichia coli, where the circuit function was specified using Verilog code and transformed to a DNA sequence. The DNA sequences were built as specified with no additional tuning, requiring 880,000 base pairs of DNA assembly. Of these, 45 circuits performed correctly in every output state (up to 10 regulators and 55 parts). Across all circuits, 92\% of the 412 output states functioned as predicted.
CONCLUSIONOur work constitutes a hardware description language for programming living cells. This required the co-development of design algorithms with gates that are sufficiently simple and robust to be connected by automated algorithms. We demonstrate that engineering principles can be applied to identify and suppress errors that complicate the compositions of larger systems. This approach leads to highly repetitive and modular genetics, in stark contrast to the encoding of natural regulatory networks. The use of a hardware-independent language and the creation of additional UCFs will allow a single design to be transformed into DNA for different organisms, genetic endpoints, operating conditions, and gate technologies. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/352/6281/aac7341/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Genetic programming using Cello.A user specifies the desired circuit function in Verilog code, and this is transformed into a DNA sequence.

Computation can be performed in living cells by DNA-encoded circuits that process sensory information and control biological functions. Their construction is time-intensive, requiring manual part assembly and balancing of regulator expression. We describe a design environment, Cello, in which a user writes Verilog code that is automatically transformed into a DNA sequence. Algorithms build a circuit diagram, assign and connect gates, and simulate performance. Reliable circuit design requires the insulation of gates from genetic context, so that they function identically when used in different circuits. We used Cello to design 60 circuits for Escherichia coli (880,000 base pairs of DNA), for which each DNA sequence was built as predicted by the software with no additional tuning. Of these, 45 circuits performed correctly in every output state (up to 10 regulators and 55 parts), and across all circuits 92\% of the output states functioned as predicted. Design automation simplifies the incorporation of genetic circuits into biotechnology projects that require decision-making, control, sensing, or spatial organization.

  abstract = {Genetic circuits require many regulatory parts in order to implement signal processing or execute algorithms in cells. A potentially scalable approach is to use dCas9, which employs small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to repress genetic loci via the programmability of RNA:DNA base pairing. To this end, we use dCas9 and designed sgRNAs to build transcriptional logic gates and connect them to perform computation in living cells. We constructed a set of NOT gates by designing five synthetic Escherichia coli σ70 promoters that are repressed by corresponding sgRNAs, and these interactions do not exhibit crosstalk between each other. These sgRNAs exhibit high on‐target repression (56‐ to 440‐fold) and negligible off‐target interactions ({$<$} 1.3‐fold). These gates were connected to build larger circuits, including the Boolean‐complete NOR gate and a 3‐gate circuit consisting of four layered sgRNAs. The synthetic circuits were connected to the native E. coli regulatory network by designing output sgRNAs to target an E. coli transcription factor (malT). This converts the output of a synthetic circuit to a switch in cellular phenotype (sugar utilization, chemotaxis, phage resistance).

Genetic gates are assembled based on dCas9 and engineered small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that drive Cas9 to target promoters. These transcriptional gates are linked to build larger genetic circuits that are connected to the natural regulatory network of the cell.

Synthetic promoters and cognate sgRNAs exhibit large dynamic range and negligible crosstalk.sgRNA‐based NOT gate response functions are non‐cooperative and quantitatively different from those based on transcriptional repressors.Multi‐input logic gates are constructed by layering orthogonal sgRNAs.Host regulatory networks can be interfaced through the design of sgRNA circuit outputs targeted to native transcription factors.},

  abstract = {Synthetic gene circuits perturb the physiology of their cellular host. The extra load on endogenous processes shifts the equilibrium of resource allocation in the host, leading to slow growth and reduced biosynthesis. Here we built integrated host-circuit models to quantify growth defects caused by synthetic gene circuits. Simulations reveal a complex relation between circuit output and cellular capacity for gene expression. For weak induction of heterologous genes, protein output can be increased at the expense of growth defects. Yet for stronger induction, cellular capacity reaches a tipping point, beyond which both gene expression and growth rate drop sharply. Extensive simulations across various growth conditions and large regions of the design space suggest that the critical capacity is a result of ribosomal scarcity. We studied the impact of growth defects on various gene circuits and transcriptional logic gates, which highlights the extent to which cellular burden can limit, shape, and even break down circuit function.

The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.},

  abstract = {The gut microbiome is a complex microbial community that has a significant influence on the host. Microbial interactions in the gut are mediated by dietary substrates, especially complex polysaccharides. In this environment, breakdown products from larger carbohydrates and short chain fatty acids are commonly shared among gut microbes. Understanding the forces that guide microbiome development and composition is important to determine its role in health and in the intervention of the gut microbiome as a therapeutic tool. Recently, modeling approaches such as genome-scale models and time-series analyses have been useful to predict microbial interactions. In this study, a bottom-up approach was followed to develop a mathematical model based on microbial growth equations that incorporate metabolic sharing and inhibition. The model was developed using experimental in vitro data from a system comprising four microorganisms of the infant gut microbiome (Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides vulgatus), one substrate (fructooligosaccharides, FOS), and evaluating two metabolic products (acetate and lactate). After parameter optimization, the model accurately predicted bacterial abundance in co-cultures from mono-culture data. In addition, a good correlation was observed between the experimental data with predicted FOS consumption and acid production. B. infantis and L. acidophilus were dominant under these conditions. Further model validation included cultures with the four-species in a bioreactor using FOS. The model was able to predict the predominance of the two aforementioned species, as well as depletion of acetate and lactate. Finally, the model was tested for parameter identifiability and sensitivity. These results suggest that variations in microbial abundance and activities in the infant gut were mainly explained by metabolic interactions, and could be properly modeled using Monod kinetics with metabolic interactions. The model could be scaled to include data from larger consortia, or be applied to microbial communities where sharing metabolic resources is important in shaping bacterial abundance. Moreover, the model could be useful in designing microbial consortia with desired properties such as higher acid production.},

  abstract = {A fundamental step in synthetic biology and systems biology is to derive appropriate mathematical models for the purposes of analysis and design. For example, to synthesize a gene regulatory network, the derivation of a mathematical model is important in order to carry out in silico investigations of the network dynamics and to investigate parameter variations and robustness issues. Different mathematical frameworks have been proposed to derive such models. In particular, the use of sets of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has been proposed to model the dynamics of the concentrations of mRNAs and proteins. These models are usually characterized by the presence of highly nonlinear Hill function terms. A typical simplification is to reduce the number of equations by means of a quasi-steady-state assumption on the mRNA concentrations. This yields a class of simplified ODE models. A radically different approach is to replace the Hill functions by piecewise-linear approximations [Casey, R., de Jong, H., Gouze´, J.-L., 2006. Piecewise-linear models of genetic regulatory networks: equilibria and their stability. J. Math. Biol. 52 (1), 27–56]. A further modelling approach is the use of discrete-time maps [Coutinho, R., Fernandez, B., Lima, R., Meyroneinc, A., 2006. Discrete time piecewise affine models of genetic regulatory networks. J. Math. Biol. 52, 524–570] where the evolution of the system is modelled in discrete, rather than continuous, time. The aim of this paper is to discuss and compare these different modelling approaches, using a representative gene regulatory network. We will show that different models often lead to conflicting conclusions concerning the existence and stability of equilibria and stable oscillatory behaviours. Moreover, we shall discuss, where possible, the viability of making certain modelling approximations (e.g. quasi-steady-state mRNA dynamics or piecewise-linear approximations of Hill functions) and their effects on the overall system dynamics.},

This system, which we call CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. CRISPRi can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. We also show evidence that the system can be adapted for gene repression in mammalian cells.

To this end, we have developed a genetic technology mapping algorithm that builds on the directed acyclic graph (DAG) based mapping techniques originally used to select parts for digital electronic circuit designs and implemented it in our GDA tool, iBioSim. It is among the first genetic technology mapping algorithms to adapt techniques from electronic circuit design, in particular the use of a cost function to guide the search for an optimal solution, and perhaps that which makes the greatest use of standards for describing genetic function and structure to represent design specifications and component libraries. This paper demonstrates the use of our algorithm to map the specifications for three different genetic circuits against four randomly generated libraries of increasing size to evaluate its performance against both exhaustive search and greedy variants for finding optimal and near-optimal solutions.},

  abstract = {Synthetic Biology offers qualitatively new perspectives on the benefits of industrially harnessed biological processes. The ability to modify and reprogramme natural biology increases the scope of tailored bioprocesses and yields attractive prospects beyond conventional Biotechnology. The present review summarises the major achievements and categorises them according to a hierarchy of system levels. Similar structures are known in the engineering sciences and might prove useful for the future development of Synthetic Biology. The hierarchy encompasses several levels of detail. Biological (macro-)molecules present the most detailed level (parts), followed by compartmentalised or non-compartmentalised modules (devices). In the next level, parts and devices are combined into functional cells and further into cellular communities. The manifold interactions between biological entities of the same hierarchical level or between different levels are accounted for by networks, primarily metabolic pathways and regulatory circuits. Networks of different types are represented as a superordinate hierarchical level that achieves full system integration. On all these levels, extensive and sound scientific foundations exist regarding experimental but also theoretical methods. These have led to diverse manifestations of Synthetic Biology on the parts and devices levels. Investigations involving synthetic components on the systems scale represent the most difficult and remain limited in number. A main challenge lies with the quantitative prediction of interactions between different entities across different scales. Systems-theoretical approaches provide important tools to analyse complex biological behaviour and can support the design of artificial biological systems. A promising strategy is seen in an efficient modularisation that reduces biological systems to a limited set of functional modules with well-characterised interfaces. For the design of synthetic biological systems the interactions across these interfaces should be standardised to reduce complexity. Yet, the identification of modules and standardised interaction routes remains a non-trivial problem. Furthermore, an appropriate platform that efficiently describes replication and evolutionary processes has to be developed in order to extend the achievements of Synthetic Biology into designed biological processes.},

The first method is a hand calculation method that uses a single variable static hazard cover algorithm. The hand calculation method can be used in the classroom and does not require computer assistance. The second method involves using a single variable static hazard cover software synthesis tool. The second method is more convenient to use outside the classroom on a PC that is available for engineering student use or perhaps on personal computers. To illustrate the process of obtaining single variable static hazard covers, the standard Karnaugh map approach is also used. A commercially available design synthesis tool and schematic capture/simulation timing tool are also used in this paper.{$<>$}},

At the same time, the complexities involved in such designs make manual designs challenging and suggest the use of evolutionary design procedures. Yet, surprisingly, there has not been an attempt so far to evolve asynchronous sequential circuits. This paper pioneers this attempt and proposes an evolutionary approach for the first time. The evolution is done at two levels using a developmental approach called the developmental Cartesian genetic programming (DCGP) technique. The first level evolution aims at evolving race-free stable circuits, satisfying the input/output combinations, with no hazards or minimal number of hazards. The second level evolution modifies/adds more components to the circuits, in order to make them hazard-free, both with respect to static as well as dynamic hazards. Experimental results for a modulo-six counter and an ISCAS'89 benchmark circuit, 'lion', are provided as a proof of concept.},

  abstract = {Interactions between RNA polymerases (RNAP) resulting from tandem or convergent arrangements of promoters can cause transcriptional interference, often with important consequences for gene expression. However, it is not known what factors determine the magnitude of interference and which mechanisms are likely to predominate in any situation. We therefore developed a mathematical model incorporating three mechanisms of transcriptional interference in bacteria: occlusion (in which passing RNAPs block access to the promoter), collisions between elongating RNAPs, and “sitting duck” interference (in which RNAP complexes waiting to fire at the promoter are removed by passing RNAP). The predictions of the model are in good agreement with a recent quantitative in vivo study of convergent promoters in E.coli. Our analysis predicts that strong occlusion requires the interfering promoter to be very strong. Collisions can also produce strong interference but only if the interfering promoter is very strong or if the convergent promoters are far apart ({$>$}200bp). For moderate strength interfering promoters and short inter-promoter distances, strong interference is dependent on the sitting duck mechanism. Sitting duck interference is dependent on the relative strengths of the two promoters. However, it is also dependent on the “aspect ratio” (the relative rates of RNAP binding and firing) of the sensitive promoter, allowing promoters of equal strength to have very different sensitivities to transcriptional interference. The model provides a framework for using transcriptional interference to investigate various dynamic processes on DNA in vivo.},

  abstract = {The inference of genetic interactions from measured expression data is one of the most challenging tasks of modern functional genomics. When successful, the learned network of regulatory interactions yields a wealth of useful information. An inferred genetic network contains information about the pathway to which a gene belongs and which genes it interacts with. Furthermore, it explains the function of the gene in terms of how it influences other genes and indicates which genes are pathway initiators and therefore potential drug targets. Obviously, such wealth comes at a price and that of genetic network modeling is that it is an extremely complex task. Therefore, it is necessary to develop sophisticated computational tools that are able to extract relevant information from a limited set of microarray measurements and integrate this with different information sources, to come up with reliable hypotheses of a genetic regulatory network. Thus far, a multitude of modeling approaches have been proposed for discovering genetic networks. However, it is unclear what the advantages and disadvantages of each of the different approaches are and how their results can be compared. In this review, genetic network models are put in a historical perspective that explains why certain models were introduced. Various modeling assumptions and their consequences are also highlighted. In addition, an overview of the principal differences and similarities between the approaches is given by considering the qualitative properties of the chosen models and their learning strategies.},

The operators of a subset were determined using an in vitro method, and this information was used to build synthetic promoters. The promoters and repressors were screened for cross-reactions. Of these, 16 were identified that both strongly repress their cognate promoter (5- to 207-fold) and exhibit minimal interactions with other promoters. Each repressor-promoter pair was converted to a NOT gate and characterized. Used as a set of 16 NOT/NOR gates, there are {$>$}1054 circuits that could be built by changing the pattern of input and output promoters.

Each cell performs a simple computational operation, but when combined with cell–cell communication, intricate patterns emerge. Here we study this process by combining a simple genetic circuit with quorum sensing to produce more complex computations in space. We construct a simple NOR logic gate in Escherichia coli by arranging two tandem promoters that function as inputs to drive the transcription of a repressor. The repressor inactivates a promoter that serves as the output. Individual colonies of E. coli carry the same NOR gate, but the inputs and outputs are wired to different orthogonal quorum-sensing ‘sender’ and ‘receiver’ devices4,5. The quorum molecules form the wires between gates. By arranging the colonies in different spatial configurations, all possible two-input gates are produced, including the difficult XOR and EQUALS functions. The response is strong and robust, with 5- to {$>$}300-fold changes between the ‘on’ and ‘off’ states. This work helps elucidate the design rules by which simple logic can be harnessed to produce diverse and complex calculations by rewiring communication between cells.},

  abstract = {None of the available minimizers for exact 2-level hazard-free logic minimization can synthesize very large circuits. This limitation has forced researchers to resort to heuristic minimization, or to manual and automated circuit partitioning techniques. This paper introduces a new implicit 2-level logic minimizer, IMPYMIN, which is able to solve very large multi-output hazard-free minimization problems exactly. The minimizer is based on a novel theoretical approach: it incorporates hazard-freedom constraints within a synchronous function by adding new variables. In particular, the generation of dynamic-hazard-free prime implicants is cast as a synchronous prime implicant generation problem. The minimizer can exactly solve all currently available examples, which range up to 32 inputs and 33 outputs, in less than 813 seconds. These include examples that have never been exactly solved before.},

We developed a generalizable model‐guided framework to predict higher‐dimensional consortia from time‐resolved measurements of lower‐order assemblages. This method was employed to decipher microbial interactions in a diverse human gut microbiome synthetic community. We show that pairwise interactions are major drivers of multi‐species community dynamics, as opposed to higher‐order interactions. The inferred ecological network exhibits a high proportion of negative and frequent positive interactions. Ecological drivers and responsive recipient species were discovered in the network. Our model demonstrated that a prevalent positive and negative interaction topology enables robust coexistence by implementing a negative feedback loop that balances disparities in monospecies fitness levels. We show that negative interactions could generate history‐dependent responses of initial species proportions that frequently do not originate from bistability. Measurements of extracellular metabolites illuminated the metabolic capabilities of monospecies and potential molecular basis of microbial interactions. In sum, these methods defined the ecological roles of major human‐associated intestinal species and illuminated design principles of microbial communities.

Analysis of microbial interactions in a synthetic human gut microbiome community shows that pairwise microbial interactions are major drivers of multi‐species community dynamics. The study reveals ecological drivers, metabolite hub species and ecologically sensitive organisms in the network.

A data‐driven pipeline is used to construct a predictive dynamic model of a diverse anaerobic human gut microbiome community.Design principles of stable coexistence and history‐dependence are elucidated.Ecological roles and metabolite profiles are analyzed for each organism.The study highlights challenges in using phylogenetic and exo‐metabolomic “signals” to predict microbial interactions and community functions.},

Well-established databases and repositories store and provide mathematical models. Recently, these databases started to distribute simulation setups together with the model code. These developments facilitate the reproduction of results. In this chapter, we outline the necessary steps towards reproducing model-based results in computational biology. We exemplify the workflow using a prominent example model of the Cell Cycle and state-of-the-art tools and standards.},

Here we constructed an orthogonal AND gate in Escherichia coli using a novel hetero-regulation module from Pseudomonas syringae. The device comprises two co-activating genes hrpR and hrpS controlled by separate promoter inputs, and a σ54-dependent hrpL promoter driving the output. The hrpL promoter is activated only when both genes are expressed, generating digital-like AND integration behaviour. The AND gate is demonstrated to be modular by applying new regulated promoters to the inputs, and connecting the output to a NOT gate module to produce a combinatorial NAND gate. The circuits were assembled using a parts-based engineering approach of quantitative characterization, modelling, followed by construction and testing. The results show that new genetic logic devices can be engineered predictably from novel native orthogonal biological control elements using quantitatively in-context characterized parts.},

Synthetic biology offers much promise in developing systems to address challenges faced in manufacturing, the environment and sustainability, and health and medicine, but the realization of this potential is currently limited by the diversity of available parts and effective design frameworks.

We present a fully automated design method called RiboLogic for such “stand-alone” riboswitches and test it via high-throughput experiments on 2875 molecules using RNA-MaP (RNA on a massively parallel array) technology. These molecules consistently modulate their affinity to the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein upon binding of flavin mononucleotide, tryptophan, theophylline, and microRNA miR-208a, achieving activation ratios of up to 20 and significantly better performance than control designs. By encompassing a wide diversity of stand-alone switches and highly quantitative data, the resulting ribologic-solves experimental data set provides a rich resource for further improvement of riboswitch models and design methods.},

  abstract = {Synthetic biology aims to engineer and redesign biological systems for useful real-world applications in biomanufacturing, biosensing and biotherapy following a typical design-build-test cycle. Inspired from computer science and electronics, synthetic gene circuits have been designed to exhibit control over the flow of information in biological systems. Two types are Boolean logic inspired TRUE or FALSE digital logic and graded analog computation. Key principles for gene circuit engineering include modularity, orthogonality, predictability~and reliability. Initial circuits in the field were small and hampered by a lack of modular and orthogonal components, however in recent years the library of available parts has increased vastly. New tools for high throughput DNA assembly and characterization have been developed enabling rapid prototyping, systematic in situ characterization, as well as automated design and assembly of circuits. Recently implemented computing paradigms in circuit memory and distributed computing using cell consortia will also be discussed. Finally, we will examine existing challenges in building predictable large-scale circuits including modularity, context dependency and metabolic burden as well as tools and methods used to resolve them. These new trends and techniques have the potential to accelerate design of larger gene circuits and result in an increase in our basic understanding of circuit and host behaviour.},

  abstract = {The construction of stable and functional synthetic circuits in bacteria is necessary in the areas of systems and synthetic biology. The common approach using plasmids to carry foreign genetic circuits offers convenience in genetic construction but is poor in genetic stability (e.g., variation in copy number). Genome recombination provides the stable genetic maintenance of synthetic circuits, but is often labor intensive and time consuming when the genetic circuits are complex and the DNA fragments become larger. The method introduced here is modified from that reported by Wanner's group and is available for integration of complex genetic circuits into the Escherichia coli chromosome.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the study of static hazards in combinational switching circuits by means of a suitable ternary switching algebra. Techniques for hazard detection and elimination are developed which are analogous to the Huffman-McCluskey procedures. However, gate and series-parallel contact networks are treated by algebraic methods exclusively, whereas a topological approach is applied to non-series-parallel contact networks only. Moreover, the paper derives necessary and sufficient conditions for a ternary function to adequately describe the steady-state and static hazard behavior of a combinational network. The sufficiency of these conditions is proved constructively leading to a method for the synthesis of combinational networks containing static hazards as specified. The section on non-series-parallel contact networks also includes a brief discussion of the applicability of lattice matrix theory to hazard detection. Finally, hazard prevention in contact networks by suitable contact sequencing techniques is discussed and a ternary map method for the synthesis of such networks is explained.},

  abstract = {As the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) data and visual standards gain acceptance for describing genetic designs in a detailed and reproducible way, there is an increasing need for an intuitive sequence editor tool that biologists can use that supports these standards. This paper describes SBOLDesigner 2, a genetic design automation (GDA) tool that natively supports both the SBOL data model (Version 2) and SBOL Visual (Version 1). This software is enabled to fetch and store parts and designs from SBOL repositories, such as SynBioHub. It can also import and export data about parts and designs in FASTA, GenBank, and SBOL 1 data format. Finally, it possesses a simple and intuitive user interface. This paper describes the design process using SBOLDesigner 2, highlighting new features over the earlier prototype versions. SBOLDesigner 2 is released freely and open source under the Apache 2.0 license.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has long been recognized that sensitivity analysis plays a key role in modeling and analyzing cellular and biochemical processes. Systems biology markup language (SBML) has become a well-known platform for coding and sharing mathematical models of such processes. However, current SBML compatible software tools are limited in their ability to perform global sensitivity analyses of these models.
RESULTS: This work introduces a freely downloadable, software package, SBML-SAT, which implements algorithms for simulation, steady state analysis, robustness analysis and local and global sensitivity analysis for SBML models. This software tool extends current capabilities through its execution of global sensitivity analyses using multi-parametric sensitivity analysis, partial rank correlation coefficient, SOBOL's method, and weighted average of local sensitivity analyses in addition to its ability to handle systems with discontinuous events and intuitive graphical user interface.
CONCLUSION: SBML-SAT provides the community of systems biologists a new tool for the analysis of their SBML models of biochemical and cellular processes.},
